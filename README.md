# JavaScript-Bubbling

Bubbling in JavaScript is just like a parent- child relationship, when you click a child which is nested in a parent tag, it gets the events from the upper nested tag till the end nest tag is reached.

All the prince has to do is to click on the guard tag and that automatically alerts the princess tag.
This is simply explains the bubbling effect!
